# Project 16: Cloud State with Terraform

This project demontrates the use of Terraform as an IaC tool to deploy a WebApp on AWS cloud. Terraform is smart enough to reduce the time consuming activity of manually configuring the cloud services to make an Infrastructure up and running, reduce considerably human errors that could sneak in during confifuration, takes very little time to update the infrastructure and has a centralised point of configuration for the management of the infrastrutuce and state maintenance. I used terraform to deploy the different services that builds up the webApp. In this project, I used code to:
 - Setup terraform with backend in S3, enabling teams to work collaboratively
 - Setup a secure and highly available VPC
 - Provision a Beanstalk environment
 - Provision backend services( RDS, Elasticache, AmazonMQ)
